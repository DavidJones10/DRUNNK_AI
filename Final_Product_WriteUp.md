## Milestone status: 

#### Despite our numerous setbacks, we were able to achieve almost every goal that we set for ourselves at the beginning of the semester. As a stretch goal, we wanted to have built "an arcade-style user-interface in which the user can select between several "games" that uniquely modify the sound through audio effects or sample selection." We can confidently say that we achieved this goal. There were obviously some shortcomings as we ultimately decided not to use our own model structures and thus could not implement the sort of AI feedback loop that we had envisioned.

## Surprises and challenges: 

#### Our biggest challenge in this stage of development was trying to find ways to increase interactivity within our games. We did quite a bit of experimenting with a variety of effects and ultimately found some interactions that we were happy with. Another challenge we faced was in the consolidation of all of our sketches onto one site. It was not incredibly difficult, but it was painfully tedious.

## Design and concept changes: 

####  Conceptually, our system has not undergone many changes since the beta or even the MVP. We have been slowly carrying out many of the goals that we set for ourselves at the beginning. This is not to say that we haven't made compromises and numerous changes to implementations of these designs. We have gone through several iterations of each game to find the best possible effects for each of the interaction, which proved to be a long and arduous process.

## Technical changes:

#### Sticking with p5.js definitely introduced some challenges in this stage of the development. We found ourselves having to do a lot of extra work to manage all three sketches at once. We know that with other tools, it would have been much easier. We also hit some roadblocks when researching hosting our server. Theoretically, it would not have been very difficult to host, but it would have been a much faster and possibly unecessary process if we had converted our models to ONNX and run them in JavaScript instead of python.

## Remaining Work:

#### We ran into some issues as we all began working on our perspective tasks while simultaneously trying to integrate them into the master sketch. The biggest problem we faced was that all of the integration was done by one group member, so when other group members would update their code on their old files, the group member who was doing the integration had to interpret, edit, and reformat much of the code for all of the minigames.
